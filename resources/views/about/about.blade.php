                    Corey, also known as Trader Toks is a Youtuber, Investor/Trader, and most 
                    importantly devilishly handsome. 

                    Corey first discovered trading in
                    highschool and devoted his life early on to 
                    studying technical analysis. He quickly learned that the internet is riddled 
                    with misinformation and decided to share what he has learned over several
                    years through social media. Thus, Tradertoks was born.
